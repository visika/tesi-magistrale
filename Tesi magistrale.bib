  abstract = {The rapid progress of machine learning interatomic potentials over the past couple of years produced a number of new architectures. Particularly notable among these are the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), which unified many of the earlier ideas around atom density-based descriptors, and Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), a message passing neural network with equivariant features that showed state of the art accuracy. In this work, we construct a mathematical framework that unifies these models: ACE is generalised so that it can be recast as one layer of a multi-layer architecture. From another point of view, the linearised version of NequIP is understood as a particular sparsification of a much larger polynomial model. Our framework also provides a practical tool for systematically probing different choices in the unified design space. We demonstrate this by an ablation study of NequIP via a set of experiments looking at in- and out-of-domain accuracy and smooth extrapolation very far from the training data, and shed some light on which design choices are critical for achieving high accuracy. Finally, we present BOTNet (Body-Ordered-Tensor-Network), a much-simplified version of NequIP, which has an interpretable architecture and maintains accuracy on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Machine-learned force fields have transformed the atomistic modelling of materials by enabling simulations of ab initio quality on unprecedented time and length scales. However, they are currently limited by: (i) the significant computational and human effort that must go into development and validation of potentials for each particular system of interest; and (ii) a general lack of transferability from one chemical system to the next. Here, using the state-of-the-art MACE architecture we introduce a single general-purpose ML model, trained on a public database of 150k inorganic crystals, that is capable of running stable molecular dynamics on molecules and materials. We demonstrate the power of the MACE-MP-0 model -- and its qualitative and at times quantitative accuracy -- on a diverse set problems in the physical sciences, including the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and chemical reactions. The model can be applied out of the box and as a starting or "foundation model" for any atomistic system of interest and is thus a step towards democratising the revolution of ML force fields by lowering the barriers to entry.},

  abstract = {Creating fast and accurate force fields is a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry and materials science. Recently, several equivariant message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been shown to outperform models built using other approaches in terms of accuracy. However, most MPNNs suffer from high computational cost and poor scalability. We propose that these limitations arise because MPNNs only pass two-body messages leading to a direct relationship between the number of layers and the expressivity of the network. In this work, we introduce MACE, a new equivariant MPNN model that uses higher body order messages. In particular, we show that using four-body messages reduces the required number of message passing iterations to just two, resulting in a fast and highly parallelizable model, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art accuracy on the rMD17, 3BPA, and AcAc benchmark tasks. We also demonstrate that using higher order messages leads to an improved steepness of the learning curves.},

  abstract = {ConspectusMolecular crystals occur widely in pharmaceuticals, foods, explosives, organic semiconductors, and many other applications. Thanks to substantial progress in electronic structure modeling of molecular crystals, attention is now shifting from basic crystal structure prediction and lattice energy modeling toward the accurate prediction of experimentally observable properties at finite temperatures and pressures. This Account discusses how fragment-based electronic structure methods can be used to model a variety of experimentally relevant molecular crystal properties. First, it describes the coupling of fragment electronic structure models with quasi-harmonic techniques for modeling the thermal expansion of molecular crystals, and what effects this expansion has on thermochemical and mechanical properties.Excellent agreement with experiment is demonstrated for the molar volume, sublimation enthalpy, entropy, and free energy, and the bulk modulus of phase I carbon dioxide when large basis second-order M{\o}ller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) or coupled cluster theories (CCSD(T)) are used. In addition, physical insight is offered into how neglect of thermal expansion affects these properties. Zero-point vibrational motion leads to an appreciable expansion in the molar volume; in carbon dioxide, it accounts for around 30\% of the overall volume expansion between the electronic structure energy minimum and the molar volume at the sublimation point. In addition, because thermal expansion typically weakens the intermolecular interactions, neglecting thermal expansion artificially stabilizes the solid and causes the sublimation enthalpy to be too large at higher temperatures. Thermal expansion also frequently weakens the lower-frequency lattice phonon modes; neglecting thermal expansion causes the entropy of sublimation to be overestimated. Interestingly, the sublimation free energy is less significantly affected by neglecting thermal expansion because the systematic errors in the enthalpy and entropy cancel somewhat.Second, because solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) plays an increasingly important role in molecular crystal studies, this Account discusses how fragment methods can be used to achieve higher-accuracy chemical shifts in molecular crystals. Whereas widely used plane wave density functional theory models are largely restricted to generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals like PBE in practice, fragment methods allow the routine use of hybrid density functionals with only modest increases in computational cost. In extensive molecular crystal benchmarks, hybrid functionals like PBE0 predict chemical shifts with 20--30\% higher accuracy than GGAs, particularly for 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei. Due to their higher sensitivity to polarization effects, 17O chemical shifts prove slightly harder to predict with fragment methods. Nevertheless, the fragment model results are still competitive with those from GIPAW.The improved accuracy achievable with fragment approaches and hybrid density functionals increases discrimination between different potential assignments of individual shifts or crystal structures, which is critical in NMR crystallography applications. This higher accuracy and greater discrimination are highlighted in application to the solid state NMR of different acetaminophen and testosterone crystal forms.},

Crystal engineering offers a number of routes to improved solubility and dissolution rate, which can be adopted through an in-depth knowledge of crystallisation processes and the molecular properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients. This article covers the concept and theory of crystal engineering and discusses the potential benefits, disadvantages and methods of preparation of co-crystals, metastable polymorphs, high-energy amorphous forms and ultrafine particles. Also considered within this review is the influence of crystallisation conditions on crystal habit and particle morphology with potential implications for dissolution and oral absorption.},

However, accurate machine learning potentials come with relatively high computational costs that limit their ability to predict properties requiring extensive sampling, large simulation cells, or long runs to converge. Here, we have developed and tested a neuroevolution-potential model for water trained to hybrid-dispersion-corrected density functional calculations. This model exhibits accuracy and transferability comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning potentials but at a much lower computational cost. As a result, it enabled us to compute well-converged thermodynamic averages and fluctuations. This allowed us to assess the ability of our model to reproduce several thermodynamic properties of water and ice as well as the anomalous behavior of water density, heat capacity, and compressibility. The efficient GPU acceleration of our model and its capability to reproduce water thermodynamics in good agreement with experiments make it suitable for simulating phase transitions and slow dynamic processes in aqueous systems.},

Recent discoveries mean that there are now 20 distinct polymorphs; a structural diversity that arises from a delicate interplay of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals dispersion forces. This wealth of structures provides a stern test of electronic structure theories, with Density Functional Theory (DFT) often not able to accurately characterize the relative energies of the various ice polymorphs. Thanks to recent advances that enable the accurate and efficient treatment of molecular crystals with Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), we present here the DMC-ICE13 dataset; a dataset of lattice energies of 13 ice polymorphs. This dataset encompasses the full structural complexity found in the ambient and high-pressure molecular ice polymorphs, and when experimental reference energies are available, our DMC results deliver sub-chemical accuracy. Using this dataset, we then perform an extensive benchmark of a broad range of DFT functionals. Of the functionals considered, revPBE-D3 and RSCAN reproduce reference absolute lattice energies with the smallest error, while optB86b-vdW and SCAN+rVV10 have the best performance on the relative lattice energies. Our results suggest that a single functional achieving reliable performance for all phases is still missing, and that care is needed in the selection of the most appropriate functional for the desired application. The insights obtained here may also be relevant to liquid water and other hydrogen-bonded and dispersion-bonded molecular crystals.},

  abstract = {Despite the simplicity of water molecules, for more than a century, a lot of scientific effort has been made on exploring ice polymorphism, especially more elusive phases such as cubic ice Ic. In this work, measurement of the density of phonon states (DOPSs) of polycrystalline ice Ic, and of its deuterated counterpart, has been performed in a sample having an almost perfect crystallographic purity, obtained from the transformation of ice XVII, and with a remarkable accuracy. Results are compared with the new accurate measurements of DOPSs in ice Ih and with centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations. The differences between the experimental DOPSs in these two forms of ice are subtle but quantitatively measurable. In addition, they are reproduced semiquantitatively by computational methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of this innovative simulation tool for calculating the dynamical properties of ice structures.},

The diffraction pattern is indexed with a hexagonal cell and can be refined with space group P6122 so as to obtain accurate values of the oxygen and deuterium positions. The values of the lattice constants at three temperatures between 25 and 100 K are reported, and their behavior is compared with that of ice Ih. Ice XVII is a microporous solid that, if exposed to H2 gas, may adsorb a substantial amount of it. Monitoring this effect at a constant temperature of 50 K, we have observed that the two lattice constants show opposite behavior, a increases and c decreases, with the volume showing a linear increase. At temperatures higher than 130 K, the metastability of this form of microporous ice is lost and the sample transforms into ice Ih.},

For this purpose, thermally-expanded structures were calculated               via               the quasi-harmonic approximation utilizing three dispersion-inclusive density-functional approximations. Experimental unit-cell volumes were back-corrected for thermal and zero-point energy effects, allowing now a direct comparison with lattice relaxations based on electronic energies. For the derivation of reference lattice energies, we utilized harmonic vibrational contributions averaged over four density-functional approximations. In addition, the new reference values also take the change in electronic and vibrational energy due to thermal expansion into account. This is accomplished by either utilizing experimentally determined cell volumes and heat capacities, or by relying on the quasi-harmonic approximation. The new X23b reference values obtained this way will enable a more accurate benchmark for the performance of computational methods for molecular crystals.},

  abstract = {Molecular beams of hydrogen bonded water dimer, generated in a supersonic nozzle, have been studied using electric resonance spectroscopy. Radiofrequency and microwave transitions have been observed in (H2\,16O)2, (D2\,16O)2, and (H2\,18O)2. Transitions arising from both pure rotation and rotation--tunneling occur. The pure rotational transitions have been fit to a rigid rotor model to obtain structural information. Information on the relative orientation of the two monomer units is also contained in the electric dipole moment component along the A inertial axis {$\mu$}a, which is obtained from Stark effect measurements. The resultant structure is that of a ''trans-linear'' complex with an oxygen--oxygen distance ROO of 2.98(1) {\AA}, the proton accepting water axis is 58(6) {$^\circ$} with respect to ROO, and the proton donating water axis at -51(6) {$^\circ$} with respect to ROO. This structure is consistent with a linear hydrogen bond and the proton acceptor tetrahedrally oriented to the hydrogen bond. The limits of uncertainty are wholly model dependent and are believed to cover variations from the zero-point vibrational structure observed to the equilibrium structure. {$\mu$}a shows strong dependence on J and K and is about 2.6 D. Centrifugal distortion constants have been interpreted in terms of the monomer--monomer stretching frequency and give {$\omega$}=150 cm-1.},

The results agree satisfactorily with those of earlier measurements in the region T\&gt; 10{$^\circ$}K, and do not significantly affect the value of the residual entropy of ice calculated by Giauque and Stout [W. F. Giauque and J. W. Stout, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 58, 1144 (1936)]. Although the new results do not influence the existing thermodynamic description of ice, they provide information which is important in understanding its vibrational properties. In the first place, extrapolation of the results to T=0{$^\circ$}K yields a value of {$\Theta$}0, the Debye characteristic temperature corresponding to continuum behavior. This is found to agree satisfactorily with {$\Theta$} (elastic) estimated from the elastic constants of ice. In the second place, complete {$\Theta$}D(T) curves can be constructed, and an examination of these, computed for different sizes of vibrational unit, enables the gross features of the lattice frequency spectrum of ice to be determined. The conclusion reached is that the three components of the spectrum, due respectively to translational and rotational vibrations of the water molecule and to intramolecular vibrations, are well separated. The contribution of the librational modes to the thermodynamic properties can be approximated rather well by a single frequency of 620 cm---1.},

We study carefully the dependence of the results of elastic constants calculations on the deformation rates. The system size effects are considered as well. The comparison with the experimental data enriches our understanding of the transitions observed. Our modeling gives new information about the formation mechanisms of new phase clusters during the transition between low-density and high-density amorphous ices.

  abstract = {Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) has become established as an indispensable tool for investigating aqueous systems of all kinds, including those important in chemistry, surface science, biology, and the earth sciences. Nevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures, and liquid water, with the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC approximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate balance between compact and extended structures of many different water systems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work, we argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted, and we also discuss the substantial differences between different representations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system that rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water systems, and we suggest possible future developments.},

  abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn--Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%--40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

We also performed density functional theory calculations of the lattice dynamics. The anomalous expansion is quantitatively reproduced from the analysis of the neutron data as well as from the ab initio calculations. Further, the ab initio calculations are used to visualize the nature of anharmonic phonons across a large part of the Brillouin zone. We find that the negative thermal expansion below 60 K in the hexagonal plane is due to anharmonic librational motion of the hexagonal rings of the ice molecules, and that along the hexagonal axis originates from the transverse vibrations of the hexagonal layers.},

Calculations were carried out at the MP2 level with various basis sets up to the aug-cc-pVQZ one. Besides harmonic vibrational frequencies twelve-dimensional anharmonic frequencies were also determined using the second-order perturbation treatment. Harmonic and anharmonic frequencies were based on CP-corrected Hessians. The equilibrium geometry of the dimer differs from that determined by a standard optimization and the difference becomes small only for the largest basis set (aug-cc-pVQZ). The best theoretical estimate of the intermolecular oxygen--oxygen distance (2.92 {\AA}) is shorter than the experimental result of 2.95 {\AA}. An estimate of the complete basis set limit of the stabilization energy was obtained by extrapolating the stabilization energies as a function of the reciprocal size of the basis set; this value (21.05 kJ mol-1) is slightly smaller than other literature estimates. Adding the changes due to zero-point energy and temperature-dependent enthalpy terms (determined using anharmonic frequencies obtained from the CP-corrected Hessian) we obtain an estimate to the theoretical stabilization enthalpy at 375 K (12.76 kJ mol-1) which is by 0.8--1.3 kJ mol-1 smaller than the literature results. Our theoretical value supports the very low limit of the experimental value. Red shift of the O--H stretching frequency accompanying formation of the dimer was determined at various theoretical levels and best agreement with the experimental value was found for anharmonic frequencies calculated with CP-corrected Hessians.},

However, they present a long-standing challenge for modeling, as often minuscule free energy differences are sensitively affected by the description of electronic structure, the statistical mechanics of the nuclei and the cell, and thermal expansion. The importance of these effects has been individually established, but rigorous free energy calculations for general molecular compounds, which simultaneously account for all effects, have hitherto not been computationally viable. Here we present an efficient ``end to end'' framework that seamlessly combines state-of-the art electronic structure calculations, machine-learning potentials, and advanced free energy methods to calculate ab initio Gibbs free energies for general organic molecular materials. The facile generation of machine-learning potentials for a diverse set of polymorphic compounds---benzene, glycine, and succinic acid---and predictions of thermodynamic stabilities in qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiments highlight that predictive thermodynamic studies of industrially relevant molecular materials are no longer a daunting task.},

  abstract = {We have resolved the inconsistency in quantifying the surface potential at the liquid-vapor interface when using explicit ab initio electronic charge density and effective atomic partial charge models of liquid water. This is related, in part, to the fact that the resulting electric potentials from partial-charge models and ab initio charge distributions are quite different except for those regions of space between the molecules. We show that the electrostatic surface potential from a quantum mechanical charge distribution compares well to high-energy electron diffraction and electron holography measurements, as opposed to the comparison with electrochemical measurements. We suggest that certain regions of space be excluded when comparing computed surface potentials with electrochemical measurements. This work describes a novel interpretation of ab initio computed surface potentials through high-energy electron holography measurements as useful benchmarks toward a better understanding of electrochemistry.},

However, predicting these quantities at first-principles accuracy -- even with the aid of machine learning potentials -- is a challenge that requires sub-kJ/mol accuracy in the potential energy surface and finite-temperature sampling. We present an accurate and data-efficient protocol based on fine-tuning of the foundational MACE-MP-0 model and showcase its capabilities on sublimation enthalpies and physical properties of ice polymorphs. Our approach requires only a few tens of training structures to achieve sub-kJ/mol accuracy in the sublimation enthalpies and sub 1 \% error in densities for polymorphs at finite temperature and pressure. Exploiting this data efficiency, we explore simulations of hexagonal ice at the random phase approximation level of theory at experimental temperatures and pressures, calculating its physical properties, like pair correlation function and density, with good agreement with experiments. Our approach provides a way forward for predicting the stability of molecular crystals at finite thermodynamic conditions with the accuracy of correlated electronic structure theory.},

Various quantum chemical methods and high-quality basis sets have been applied---that is, at the level of a nearly complete basis---and both the intermolecular separation and the deformation of the donor and acceptor molecules have been optimized at the level of CCSD(T) theory (coupled-cluster theory with singles and doubles excitations plus a perturbation correction for connected triples). It is found at the CCSD(T) level that the monomer deformation in the dimer amounts to 86\% of the deformation computed at the MP2 level (second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory) and that the core/valence electron correlation effects at the CCSD(T) level amount to 80\% of the same effects at the MP2 level. The equilibrium O{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}O distance is determined as Re=291.2{\textpm}0.5 pm and the equilibrium dissociation energy as De=21.0{\textpm}0.2 kJ mol-1, with respect to dissociation into two isolated water molecules at equilibrium. Accounting for zero-point vibrational energy, the theoretical prediction for the dissociation energy becomes D0=13.8{\textpm}0.4 kJ mol-1, a result which is open to direct experimental verification.},

We have performed a series of large-scale simulations using a number of parameter-free exchange and correlation functionals, to minimize and investigate the influence of finite size effects as well as statistical errors. We find that finite size effects in structural properties are rather small and, given an extensive sampling, reproducible. On the other hand, the influence of finite size effects on dynamical properties are much larger than generally appreciated. So much so that the infinite size limit is practically out of reach. However, using a finite size scaling procedure, thanks to the greater effectiveness of our new method we can estimate both the thermodynamic value of the diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity. The hydrogen bond network structure and its kinetics are consistent with the conventional view of tetrahedrally coordinated water.},

For an accurate description of the hydrogen bonding in the liquid, it was necessary to extend the exchange functional with a term that depends on the gradient of the electron density. A further important technical detail is that supersoft pseudopotentials were used to treat the valence orbitals of the oxygen atoms in a plane wave expansion. The structural and dynamical properties of the liquid were found to be in good agreement with experiment. The ab\hphantom{,}initio molecular dynamics also yields information on the electronic structure. The electronic feature of special interest is the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the liquid which is the state occupied by a thermalized excess electron in the conductive state. The main result of calculating the liquid LUMO is that it is a delocalized state distributed over interstitial space between the molecules with a significant admixture of the {$\sigma$}* orbitals of the individual water molecules.},

First, we briefly introduce first principles or ab initio methods based on density functional theory (DFT). Then, the question of how to calculate the properties of Mn+1AXn compounds is introduced, and these calculated results are also summarized. Moreover, the calculated results for the effect of pressure on the structural, electronic, mechanical and optical properties of Mn+1AXn are also discussed and summarized.},

It is found that the LaAlO3 transforms from rhombohedral R-3C phase to cubic PM-3M phase with a volume change of 1\% when the applied hydrostatic pressure is 15.4 GPa, which is consistent with the experimental value. The elastic constants, shear modulus, bulk modulus, and Poisson's ratio of LaAlO3 are calculated and compared with corresponding experimental data. Our result shows that the rotation of the AlO6 octahedra in LaAlO3 has a large influence on the anisotropic elastic constants. From the calculated Debye temperature and elastic constants, the R-3C phase of LaAlO3 is predicted to be more thermostable and to exhibit higher fracture toughness than the high-pressured PM-3M phase.},

A combination of X-ray single-crystal and very-high flux powder neutron diffraction data confirmed that a proton does transfer from the acid to the base in the high-temperature form. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrated that the transition was reversible but that a significant kinetic energy barrier must be overcome to revert to the original structure. Computational modeling is consistent with these results. Modeling also revealed that, while the proton transfer event would be strongly discouraged in the gas phase, it occurs in the solid state due to the increase in charge state of the molecular ions and their arrangement inside the lattice. The color change is attributed to a narrowing of the squaric acid to bipyridine charge-transfer energy gap. Finally, evidence for the possible existence of two further phases at high pressure is also presented.},

This PES is empirically adjusted to improve the agreement between the computed line positions and those from the HITRAN 92 data base with J{$\leq$}5 for H216O. The changes in the PES are small, nonetheless including an estimate of core (oxygen 1s) electron correlation greatly improves the agreement with the experiment. Using this adjusted PES, we can match 30\,092 of the 30\,117 transitions in the HITRAN 96 data base for H216O with theoretical lines. The 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 percentiles of the difference between the calculated and tabulated line positions are -0.11,\hphantom{,}-0.04,\hphantom{,}-0.01,\hphantom{,}0.02, and 0.07\hphantom{,}cm-1. Nonadiabatic effects are not explicitly included. About 3\% of the tabulated line positions appear to be incorrect. Similar agreement using this adjusted PES is obtained for the 17O and 18O isotopes. For HD16O, the agreement is not as good, with a root-mean-square error of 0.25 cm-1 for lines with J{$\leq$}5. This error is reduced to 0.02 cm-1 by including a small asymmetric correction to the PES, which is parameterized by simultaneously fitting to HD16O and D216O data. Scaling this correction by mass factors yields good results for T2O and HTO. The intensities summed over vibrational bands are usually in good agreement between the calculations and the tabulated results, but individual line strengths can differ greatly. A high-temperature list consisting of 307\,721\,352 lines is generated for H216O using our PES and dipole moment function.},

  abstract = {A computational method of predicting all the polymorphs of an organic molecule would be a valuable complement to polymorph screening in the developmental phase. Such a computational method is in its early stages of development, and the current methodologies, which are based on searches for the most stable lattice structure, are critically reviewed. This crude thermodynamic approach generally overestimates the propensity for polymorphism, at least for most of the molecules studied so far, showing the need to model kinetic effects as well as to refine the thermodynamic models. Although the ultimate goal of these studies is still far off, computational predictions of crystal structures have proved useful in aiding the characterisation of polymorphs from powder X-ray data, and in providing insights into the range of types of packing that may be adopted by a given molecule. Thus, computational studies already have the potential to be a valuable tool in pharmaceutical solid state science.},

Here we expand on our recent study of the importance of many-body van der Waals interactions in molecular crystals [A. M. Reilly and A. Tkatchenko, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 4, 1028 (2013)], with a larger database of 23 molecular crystals. Particular attention has been paid to the role of the vibrational contributions that are required to compare experiment sublimation enthalpies with calculated lattice energies, employing both phonon calculations and experimental heat-capacity data to provide harmonic and anharmonic estimates of the vibrational contributions. Exact exchange, which is rarely considered in DFT studies of molecular crystals, is shown to have a significant contribution to lattice energies, systematically improving agreement between theory and experiment. When the vibrational and exact-exchange contributions are coupled with a many-body approach to dispersion, DFT yields a mean absolute error (3.92 kJ/mol) within the coveted "chemical accuracy" target (4.2 kJ/mol). The role of many-body dispersion for structures has also been investigated for a subset of the database, showing good performance compared to X-ray and neutron diffraction crystal structures. The results show that the approach employed here can reach the demanding accuracy of crystal-structure prediction and organic material design with minimal empiricism.},

  abstract = {Molecular crystals often exist in multiple competing polymorphs, showing significantly different physicochemical properties. Computational crystal structure prediction is key to interpret and guide the search for the most stable or useful form, a real challenge due to the combinatorial search space, and the complex interplay of subtle effects that work together to determine the relative stability of different structures. Here we take a comprehensive approach based on different flavors of thermodynamic integration in order to estimate all contributions to the free energies of these systems with density-functional theory, including the oft-neglected anharmonic contributions and nuclear quantum effects. We take the two main stable forms of paracetamol as a paradigmatic example. We find that anharmonic contributions, different descriptions of van der Waals interactions, and nuclear quantum effects all matter to quantitatively determine the stability of different phases. Our analysis highlights the many challenges inherent in the development of a quantitative and predictive framework to model molecular crystals. However, it also indicates which of the components of the free energy can benefit from a cancellation of errors that can redeem the predictive power of approximate models, and suggests simple steps that could be taken to improve the reliability of ab initio crystal structure prediction.},

Here, the experimental progress of the last couple of years is reviewed, and open questions as well as future challenges are discussed. The specific topics include (i) the polytypism and stacking disorder of ice I, (ii) the mechanism of the pressure amorphization of ice I, (iii) the emptying of gas-filled clathrate hydrates to give new low-density ice polymorphs, (iv) the effects of acid/base doping on hydrogen-ordering phase transitions as well as (v) the formation of solid solutions between salts and the ice polymorphs, and the effect this has on the appearance of the phase diagram. In addition to continuing efforts to push the boundaries in terms of the extremes of pressure and temperature, the exploration of the ``chemical'' dimensions of ice research appears to now be a newly emerging trend. It is without question that ice research has entered a very exciting era.},

Core correlation effects were treated accurately by augmenting the original valence basis with extended sets of core polarization functions. The MP2 dimer interaction energy at the basis set limit was determined to -4.94{\textpm}0.02 kcal/mol, with a contribution due to core correlation of -0.04 kcal/mol. Furthermore, based on some elementary considerations from intermolecular perturbation theory, a simple procedure was devised, which brings the counterpoise corrected interaction energies of moderate basis set calculations closer to the basis set limit. The interaction energies so obtained turned out be surprisingly stable with respect to extensions of the basis set.},

Each of these measurements represents a significant development of the x-ray diffraction technique applied to the study of liquid water.

The oxygen-hydrogen contribution to the measured x-ray scattering pattern was subtracted using literature data to yield an experimental determination, with error bars, of the oxygen-oxygen pair-distribution function, gOO(r), which essentially describes the distribution of molecular centers. The extended Q-range and low statistical noise of these measurements has significantly reduced truncation effects and related errors in the gOO(r) functions obtained. From these measurements and error analysis, the position and height of the nearest neighbor maximum in gOO(r) were found to be 2.80(1) {\AA} and 2.57(5) respectively. Numerical data for the coherent differential x-ray scattering cross-section IX(Q), the oxygen-oxygen structure factor SOO(Q), and the derived gOO(r) are provided as benchmarks for calibrating force-fields for water.},

In order for these data to be useful for comparing with different computer simulations and theories of water, it is first necessary to Fourier transform them to the corresponding site--site radial distribution functions. The process of doing this is not straightforward because of the inherent systematic uncertainties in the data, which arise primarily in the case of neutron scattering, from the inelasticity or recoil effects that can distort the experimental data. In this paper, it is shown that the empirical potential structure refinement procedure, which attempts to fit a three-dimensional ensemble of water molecules to all three partial structure factors simultaneously, leads to improved reliability in the extracted radial distribution functions. There are still some uncertainties, primarily associated with the hardness of the repulsive core of the intermolecular potential, which current data are not precise enough to resolve. The derived empirical potentials show some variability associated with particular experiments. General trends can be discerned however which indicate polarisation effects may be significant when effective intermolecular potentials are used over a wide temperature and density range.},

The combination of B with the semilocal correlation functional according to Lee, Yang, and Parr (BLYP) yields the best agreement with experiment.

However, these alternatives constitute virtually a continuum of architectural possibilities rather than a discrete pair of options. The singular behavior of supercooled water near --45{$^\circ$}C and the "hydrophobic" attraction between nonpolar entities are due to the same underlying phenomenon, namely, the clumping tendency of relatively strain-free convex cages or polyhedra.},

Moreover, extrapolation to higher pressures shows that the mode frequencies responsible for the NTE approach zero at {$\sim$}2.5 GPa, which explains the known pressure-induced amorphization (PIA) in ice.

  abstract = {Computer simulation plays a central role in modern-day materials science. The utility of a given computational approach depends largely on the balance it provides between accuracy and computational cost. Molecular crystals are a class of materials of great technological importance which are challenging for even the most sophisticated ab initio electronic structure theories to accurately describe. This is partly because they are held together by a balance of weak intermolecular forces but also because the primitive cells of molecular crystals are often substantially larger than those of atomic solids. Here, we demonstrate that diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) delivers subchemical accuracy for a diverse set of molecular crystals at a surprisingly moderate computational cost. As such, we anticipate that DMC can play an important role in understanding and predicting the properties of a large number of molecular crystals, including those built from relatively large molecules which are far beyond reach of other high-accuracy methods.},

  abstract = {The precise theoretical determination of the geometrical parameters of molecules at the minima of their potential energy surface and of the corresponding vibrational properties are of fundamental importance for the interpretation of vibrational spectroscopy experiments. Quantum Monte Carlo techniques are correlated electronic structure methods promising for large molecules, which are intrinsically affected by stochastic errors on both energy and force calculations, making the mentioned calculations more challenging with respect to other more traditional quantum chemistry tools. To circumvent this drawback in the present work, we formulate the general problem of evaluating the molecular equilibrium structures, the harmonic frequencies, and the anharmonic coefficients of an error affected potential energy surface. The proposed approach, based on a multidimensional fitting procedure, is illustrated together with a critical evaluation of systematic and statistical errors. We observe that the use of forces instead of energies in the fitting procedure reduces the statistical uncertainty of the vibrational parameters by 1 order of magnitude. Preliminary results based on variational Monte Carlo calculations on the water molecule demonstrate the possibility to evaluate geometrical parameters and harmonic and anharmonic coefficients at this level of theory with an affordable computational cost and a small stochastic uncertainty ({$<$}0.07\% for geometries and {$<$}0.7\% for vibrational properties).},
