	            spectroscopy. Radiofrequency and microwave transitions have been
	            observed in (H2\,16O)2, (D2\,16O)2, and (H2\,18O)2. Transitions
	            arising from both pure rotation and rotation–tunneling occur. The
	            pure rotational transitions have been fit to a rigid rotor model
	            to obtain structural information. Information on the relative
	            orientation of the two monomer units is also contained in the
	            electric dipole moment component along the A inertial axis μa,
	            which is obtained from Stark effect measurements. The resultant
	            structure is that of a ’’trans-linear’’ complex with an
	            oxygen–oxygen distance ROO of 2.98(1) Å, the proton accepting
	            water axis is 58(6) ° with respect to ROO, and the proton
	            donating water axis at −51(6) ° with respect to ROO. This

	            observed to the equilibrium structure. μa shows strong dependence
	            on J and K and is about 2.6 D. Centrifugal distortion constants

	            Various quantum chemical methods and high-quality basis sets have

	            both the intermolecular separation and the deformation of the

	            deformation in the dimer amounts to 86\% of the deformation
	            computed at the MP2 level (second-order Møller-Plesset

	            crystals, exhibiting a rich and evolving phase diagram. Recent
	            discoveries mean that there are now 20 distinct polymorphs; a
	            structural diversity that arises from a delicate interplay of
	            hydrogen bonding and van der Waals dispersion forces. This wealth
	            of structures provides a stern test of electronic structure
	            theories, with Density Functional Theory (DFT) often not able to
	            accurately characterize the relative energies of the various ice
	            polymorphs. Thanks to recent advances that enable the accurate
	            and efficient treatment of molecular crystals with Diffusion
	            Monte Carlo (DMC), we present here the DMC-ICE13 dataset; a
	            dataset of lattice energies of 13 ice polymorphs. This dataset
	            encompasses the full structural complexity found in the ambient
	            and high-pressure molecular ice polymorphs, and when experimental
	            reference energies are available, our DMC results deliver
	            sub-chemical accuracy. Using this dataset, we then perform an
	            extensive benchmark of a broad range of DFT functionals. Of the
	            functionals considered, revPBE-D3 and RSCAN reproduce reference
	            absolute lattice energies with the smallest error, while
	            optB86b-vdW and SCAN+rVV10 have the best performance on the
	            relative lattice energies. Our results suggest that a single
	            functional achieving reliable performance for all phases is still
	            missing, and that care is needed in the selection of the most
	            appropriate functional for the desired application. The insights
