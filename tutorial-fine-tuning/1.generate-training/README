1. run the molecular dynamic with macemp0 to produce an initial dataset 
> python run-ase.py (currently run-ase.py execute an NVT molecular dynamics, but you should change it to NPT at ambient pressure)

2. it will produce the trajectory md.traj
3. extract random configurations from the trajectory with  (you can change how many structures in the script)
> python select-random-structure.py
